# Automatic-File-Sorter

**<ins>Overview:</ins>**  

The Automatic File Sorter is a Python script designed to organize files based on their types into separate folders. This project aims to help users quickly and efficiently organize their files, reducing clutter and improving overall file management.

The script identifies different file types such as images, documents, videos, and archives by their extensions and creates corresponding folders for each type. It then moves the files from the specified source directory to their respective folders based on their types.

**<ins>Features:</ins>**  
- **File Type Detection:** The script uses file extensions to determine the type of each file.
- **Dynamic Folder Creation:** Folders are created automatically for each file type if they don't already exist.
- **Efficient Sorting:** Files are moved to their respective folders, keeping the directory organized.
- **Customizable:** Users can modify the source directory and reuse the script without any other change.
- **Error Handling:** Creates folders only if it is not already present. Also, moves the file only when it's not already present in its respective folder.
